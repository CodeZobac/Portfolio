Simple Bidding System

Overview:

    This Python script is a straightforward bidding system designed for small-scale auctions or similar activities. It allows multiple participants to enter their names and bid amounts. After all entries are made, the script determines and displays the highest bidder.

Features:

    -User input for names and bid amounts.
    -Support for multiple bidders.
    -Identification of the highest bid and the corresponding bidder.

Requirements:

    -Python 3.x
    -The replit module for clearing the console (used in Repl.it environments).

Usage:

    -Run the script in a Python environment.
    -Each participant inputs their name and bid amount when prompted.
    -Participants indicate whether there are other bidders.
    -Once all bids are entered, the script displays the name of the highest bidder and their bid.

Note

    -This script is intended for simple, informal use and may not be suitable for official or large-scale auctions.
    -The script uses the clear() function from the replit module, which is specific to the Repl.it environment. If running the script outside Repl.it, you may need to modify or remove this function call.
