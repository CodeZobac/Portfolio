Caesar Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor

Overview:

    The Caesar Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor is a Python-based application designed to implement the ancient and renowned Caesar cipher technique for text encryption and decryption. This script provides a straightforward, interactive interface for users to encrypt or decrypt messages using a specified alphabet shift, making it an ideal tool
    for those interested in basic cryptographic methods.

Features:

    -Encryption: Encrypts text messages by shifting each letter a specified number of places in the alphabet.
    -Decryption: Decrypts text that has been encrypted using the Caesar cipher, reversing the letter shifts.
    -Interactive CLI: User-friendly command-line interface for seamless interaction and operation.
    -Custom Shift Value: Allows users to specify the shift value (number of positions letters are moved) for customized encryption and decryption.

Usage

    -Run the Script: Launch the script in a Python interpreter.
    -Choose Mode: Select 'encode' to encrypt or 'decode' to decrypt a message.
    -Enter Message and Shift: Input your message and specify the shift number.
    -View Results: The script outputs the encrypted or decrypted message.

Pre-requisites:

    -Python 3.x installed on your machine.
    -Optional: The 'art' library for ASCII art representations.
