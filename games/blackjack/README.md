Text-Based Blackjack Game

Overview:

    -This Python script is a simple, text-based version of the classic card game Blackjack (also known as 21). The game involves drawing cards to reach a score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

Features:

    -Random card dealing.
    -Automatic score calculation.
    -Comparison between player's score and computer's score.
    -Interactive gameplay with user choices for drawing cards.

Requirements:

    -Python 3.x
    -replit module for clearing the console (optional, mostly used in Repl.it environments).

Gameplay:

    -Run the script.
    -The game starts by dealing two cards to both the player and the computer.
    -Players can choose to 'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (keep the current hand).
    -The goal is to get a score as close to 21 as possible without going over.
    -The game ends when the player decides to stand or if their score exceeds 21.
    -The winner is determined by comparing scores.

Note:

    -The script uses the replit module's clear() function, which is specific to the Repl.it environment. If running the script outside Repl.it, this function call may need to be modified or removed.
    -This game is a simplified version of Blackjack and does not include all the rules and features of the full game.
